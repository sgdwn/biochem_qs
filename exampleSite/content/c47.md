First generation antipsychotic drugs were found by accident, and were unselective in their action. This meant they had many side effects, including giving the impressing a patient has Parkinsonâ€™s. Due to their poor affinity for the target receptor, a high concentration of the drug is needed before any improvement is visible. 

Second generation drugs are more selective, but still cause unpleasant side effects.
