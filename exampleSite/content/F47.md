summary: "Complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) are hypervariable antibody loops that undergo targeted mutation to enable the identification of a wide range of antigens."

Complementarity-determining regions, CDRs, are connecting loops in the antibody protein structure that are hypervariable. Mutation is targeted in these regions during antibody differentiation, allowing almost any antigen to be identified.
