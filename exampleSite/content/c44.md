Benzodiazepines are used in emergency seizure situations, where the seizure has been ongoing for >1 minute. This increases GABA_A inhibitory neurotransmission, increasing the transport of chloride ions. 

These drugs can be addictive, and are therefore generally only used in clinical settings during emergency situations.
