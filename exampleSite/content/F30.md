summary: "Chronic inflammation, driven by factors like autoimmune reactions or high TNF-alpha levels, can cause debilitating conditions like rheumatoid arthritis and life-threatening complications like septic shock."

Chronic inflammation can result in damage being caused to the individual. For example, rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune reaction causing chronic inflammation at joints, which can only be treated with immunosuppressant drugs. This makes the patient more susceptible to infection. 

Chronic inflammation can be caused by TNF-alpha, which has systemic effects at sufficiently high concentrations (>1 mg/L). As the concentration rises further, the patient will experience septic shock, which if not treated quickly will lead to death.
