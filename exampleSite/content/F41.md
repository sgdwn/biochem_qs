summary: "Extravasation is the process of immune cells exiting capillaries and entering tissue, which can be enhanced by inflammatory mediators that increase capillary permeability."

Extravasation is the process of immune cells moving out of capillaries / the circulatory system, and into the tissue. This process can be expedited by inflammatory mediators (like TNF) to increase the permeability of the capillaries (more sinusoidal).
