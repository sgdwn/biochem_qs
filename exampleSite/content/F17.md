NETosis, or neutrophil extracellular trap-osis, is the process of a neutrophil ejecting its DNA, coated with antimicrobial peptides, around a pathogen, akin to throwing a net around a pathogen. 
This process occurs when a neutrophil is about to die, and can help target the immune system to the pathogen to resolve the infection more quickly. Altruistic.
