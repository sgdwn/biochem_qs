Personalised vaccines are a promising area of research in the context of cancer treatment. By ‘training’ the immune system to respond to antigens present exclusively on the cancer cells, it is possible to use the immune system to do the killing of these cells instead of chemical agents. This could improve clinical outcomes in patients with rarer or more complex cancers. 

These types of vaccines, developed for small numbers / individual patients, are expensive. This makes them less accessible to less wealthy patients, such as those in low/middle income countries.
