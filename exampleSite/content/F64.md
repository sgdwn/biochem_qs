summary: "Thymus-independent antigens stimulate B cells directly without T cell help, while thymus-dependent antigens require T cell presentation to B cells for antibody production and B cell differentiation."

Thymus independent antigens (TIA) are antigens that do not require T cells to elicit an adaptive immune response. Instead, TIAs can be recognised directly by membrane-bound antibodies on B cells. TIAs include bacterial polysaccharides and constant components of pathogens (eg- lipopolysaccharide, LPS). 

Thymus dependent antigens (TDA) require T cells to present the antigen to B cells for antibody synthesis. TDAs include proteins and variable molecules on pathogens. Differentiation of B cells into plasma and memory cells requires T cells, and so only occurs with TDAs.
