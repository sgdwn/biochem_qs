Widespread use of antibiotics in agriculture has helped develop many resistant bacteria that are now present in the human population. Prophylaxis involves constant, low-level dosing of antibiotics, normally through animal feed.  

With the spread of these infections to humans, through farm, processing, and cooking staff, reducing the unnecessary antibiotics use in agriculture has become a priority. Many countries have made the practice illegal, however many states with large agricultural populations still permit the practice (including the US, many Asian countries, ...).  

When new antibiotics are discovered, states should take measures to prohibit the use of these compounds in agriculture to attempt to maintain efficacy into the future.
