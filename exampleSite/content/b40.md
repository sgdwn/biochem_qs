ppGpp production is a signalling molecule produced on cell stress to slow metabolism and change protein expression. This is the intracellular general stress pheromone.  

A-signalling is used during the starvation response, inducing the synthesis of aromatic amino acids. When a certain concentration of aromatic amino acids is obtained extracellularly, a signalling cascade is activated, leading to aggregation and fruiting body formation.
