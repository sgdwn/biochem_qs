DPA is an important molecule in maintaining the stability of the DNA within a spore. Making up 10-15% of the dry weight of a spore, it dehydrates the cortex to prevent hydrolysis reactions from occurring.  

The DPA molecule is able to intercalate with pyrimidine rings in the DNA, providing further protection from radiation damage.  

DPA may provide heat protection to the spore, but this has recently been refuted.
