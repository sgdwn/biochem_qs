The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is a barrier formed of tight junctions, preventing non-specific transport into the central nervous system (CNS), providing protection from toxins and other unwanted substances. If a drug is not lipid-soluble, the BBB will prevent it from being able to access the CNS.

Therefore, drugs needing to pass the BBB must be designed specifically to do so.
