summary: "Cross-presentation is a process where cells present exogenous antigens on MHC I molecules, enabling cytotoxic T cells to target cells that are typically inaccessible to antibodies and enhancing the immune response, particularly against tumors."

Cross-presentation is the process of taking up exogenous antigen and presenting it on the cell surface with MHC I for recognition by cytotoxic T cells. Although exogenous antigen is normally only presented on MHC II (for helper T cell recognition), cross-presentation describes exogenous antigen presentation on MHC I. This allows the immune system to target cancer cells, making it easier to resolve a tumour. 

Cross-presentation enhances the immune response by allowing pathogenic cells to be targeted by cytotoxic T cells â€“ this can be useful where the cells cannot be reached by antibody (eg- deep in a tissue).
