summary: "The adaptive immune system provides highly specific and long-lasting immunity through memory cells that enable a rapid and targeted response upon re-exposure to a previously encountered antigen."
---
The adaptive immune system is able to ‘remember’ past infections, due to memory cells. These memory cells are formed during B cell differentiation, and are long-lasting, allowing rapid divisions to synthesise high levels of antibodies on activation by exposure to the same antigen. This allows a rapid and highly specific immune response against the target antigen on subsequent exposure. 

The adaptive immune system is highly specific, acting only on specific targets. This contrasts the innate immune system, which can be targeted towards any material detected as foreign. This specificity allows resources to be focused on defined targets, allowing energy to be focused, improving the killing activity of the immune system.
