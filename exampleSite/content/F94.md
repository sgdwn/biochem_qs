summary: "Convalescent plasma, while a potentially helpful early treatment option using antibodies from recovered patients to provide passive immunity, is not always effective due to varying antibody concentrations and the availability of alternative treatments."

Convalescent plasma is blood plasma taken from survivors of a disease, which is hoped to contain antibodies against the pathogen causing the outbreak. This is then transfused to patients with the infection, allowing passive immunity to be conveyed. 

However, convalescent plasma is not always effective. Some donors may not have high concentrations of the antibody in their blood, causing very little immunity to be transferred.

During the early stages of an outbreak, this can be an important way of trying to protect patients from the disease, where no other treatment options are available.
