summary: "Recombination signal sequences, with their specific 12bp/23bp pairing rule, ensure proper gene segment arrangement during somatic recombination."

Recombination signal sequences are used to ensure V(, D,) and J gene segments are recombined in the correct order during somatic recombination. These signal sequences are of different lengths, either 12bp or 23bp. A 12bp can only bind to a 23bp, and a 23bp only binds to a 12bp. This prevents two V gene segments from joining together, for example.
