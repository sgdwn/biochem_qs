summary: "In silico modelling accelerates vaccine development by identifying effective immunogens, optimizing vaccine design, and predicting safety profiles, ultimately improving efficiency and reducing development time."

In silico modelling can be used to identify methods that could be used to develop a vaccine, and is heavily involved in more modern types of vaccine (such as RNA and adeno-associated virus (AAV) vaccines). 

For subunit vaccines, which include RNA and AAV vaccines, modelling can identify possible targets that can be used as immunogens. Using bioinformatic approaches allows more possible combinations and components of the pathogen to be tested in less time, making research more efficient. 

Modelling can also be used to test the safety profile of a vaccine, allowing candidates that will cause adverse reactions to be discarded before time consuming lab processes must be conducted.
