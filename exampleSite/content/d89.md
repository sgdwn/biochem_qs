Cholera toxin is taken up by intestinal cells, causing the activation of $$G_{\alpha S}$$, preventing the signalling pathway from being turned off, due to the increased activation of adenylyl cyclase. This stimulates cells to release water and ions into the ileum of the intestine, causing diarrhoea.
