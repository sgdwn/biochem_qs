Cyanobacterial cells contain carboxysomes. These icosahedral protein structures allow CO2 to be fixed from bicarbonate with Rubisco and RuBP. This produces 3-PGA for the Calvin cycle. This increases the rate of photosynthesis.  

A potential biotechnology application for this is to insert the genes for carboxysomes into plants, forming carboxysomes in the chloroplasts. This could allow faster plant growth, increasing crop yields. Engineering plants like this could be beneficial with rising demands on agriculture, due to increasing populations.
