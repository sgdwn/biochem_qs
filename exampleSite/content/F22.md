Basophils are not phagocytic cells, like neutrophils. Instead, basophils release inflammatory mediators on activation. Molecules like histamine and heparin induce inflammation, allowing further immune activation, supporting the resolution of the infection. 

Inflammation is important to defend against parasites. Due to the larger size of parasites, it is not possible to phagocytose them. Inflammation helps prevent invasion, encouraging the parasite to pass through the body, especially in the gastrointestinal (GI) system. 

Basophils are also involved in allergy responses. On detecting an allergen, inflammatory mediators are released, causing the responses traditionally associated with allergy â€“ inflammation in the areas in contact with the allergen, and systemic inflammation in the case of some allergens.
