Class switching in B cells is the process of switching from IgM to another antibody class. This involves recombination of the constant region gene segment in the antibody gene locus, and is an irreversible process. Class switching is important to allow immune response specificity, exploiting the different biological functions of other antibody classes. 

Antibody production is changed after class switching, as a different class of antibody is synthesised. This may be more efficient, as the protein will be smaller (given IgM is the largest, and is the first expressed on initial exposure to pathogen). More antibodies can be expressed in a given period of time, with the same quantity of amino acids.
