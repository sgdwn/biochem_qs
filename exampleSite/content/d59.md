Vesicular membrane trafficking allows for membrane to be localised within a cell. This transport process is mediated by tags, normally attached to proteins on the N-terminus. This allows the cell to group proteins with the same destination together into the same vesicle. Microtubules within the cell then allow for the vesicles to be localised to their intended destination - this can be disrupted using colchicine (a drug that binds to actin, preventing microtubule formation and subsequently the collapse of Golgi).

This process does not employ restrictive checks on the location of the proteins, instead using nudges to get the proteins to the correct location. The vesicles can be recycled if protein ends up at the incorrect location, allowing it to be directed correctly. 

Membrane trafficking is an important method of controlling molecular movement in eukaryotic cells, making use of the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, and vesicles to target molecules to their intended locations. This is important in the formation of complex life, allowing the control of protein localisation, secretion of protein products, and other essential functions to allow life to exist.
