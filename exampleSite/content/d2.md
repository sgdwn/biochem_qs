Chemiosmotic theory states that ions will move across a membrane, down their concentration gradient. In bioenergetics, this relates to ATP synthesis.
By following the change in ions across a membrane (the transmembrane potential), through a method such as patch clamping, cellular processes can be studied. 
ATP synthase allows the cell to convert a potential energy (the H+ gradient) into chemical energy (ATP), producing a useful source of energy that can be used directly in cellular processes (enzyme activation, channel opening, signalling, â€¦). By studying the flow of charge across the membrane, the production of ATP can be determined, where the H+:ATP ratio is known.
