Transformation efficiency is a calculation determining the success of a bacterial transformation. This is done by determining the proportion of total number of cells being transformed, for the mass of DNA transformed. 

A higher transformation efficiency indicates more DNA being taken up by the competent cells, with more colonies present after a screening process. 

$$\text{Transformation Efficiency}=\frac{\text{Successful transformants (number)}}{\mu g\text{ of DNA transformed}}$$
