summary: "The hygiene hypothesis suggests that excessive cleanliness in early life reduces exposure to necessary pathogens, potentially disrupting immune system development and increasing the risk of allergies and autoimmune diseases."

The hygiene hypothesis describes a theory where exposure to pathogens during the early years of life is important in the development of the immune system, reducing the likelihood of dysregulation and subsequent autoimmune disease. 

Over the past fifty years, society has become obsessed with cleanliness. While this is important in some circumstances – surgery, for example – it is not necessary in the home. The proliferation of antimicrobial disinfectants and other strong detergents has led to people maintaining much cleaner residences than at any other time in human history. 

The hygiene hypothesis states that repeated exposure to pathogens is vital for determining the ratio between TH1 and TH2 cells. If this ratio is not correct, individuals will be more susceptible to allergy and autoimmune diseases.
