summary: "The lungs employ a multi-faceted defense system against infection including physical barriers like tight junctions, chemical barriers such as pulmonary surfactant, lysozymes, and cilia-driven mucus clearance, and cellular defenses via tissue-resident macrophages."

The lung epithelium contains tight junctions to prevent pathogen entry. These are proteins forming strong adhesions between neighbouring cells, inhibiting transport under healthy conditions. This is a physical barrier to infection. 
Pulmonary surfactant is secreted by type II pneumocytes. This surfactant helps maintain an ideal surface tension to prevent the collapse of alveoli, while also containing lysozymes. Lysozymes are a group of enzymes involved in killing pathogens or inhibiting their growth. This is a chemical barrier to infection. MUCUS, DEFENSINS
Cilia are found on epithelial cells lining the airways, ‘wafting’ mucus (which may contain pathogens) out of the lungs and into the stomach or nose. This is a chemical barrier to infection. 
Tissue-resident macrophages are found in mucosal surfaces, quickly responding to any non-self material that may cause problems. These are also commonly involved in asthma responses, and can secrete histamine (an inflammatory mediator) in response to pollen (as in the case of hay fever).
