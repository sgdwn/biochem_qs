The sugar molecules produced by photosynthesis form the basis of many metabolic pathways. Although ATP synthesis in mitochondria by respiration may be the most essential to cell function, sugars are also used for amino acid, nucleotide, and lipid synthesis. 

It is important for a plant to synthesise an excess of sugars, as it allows life to be sustained during periods of darkness, including at night and roots.
