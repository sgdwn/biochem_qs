The late phase asthma response is an immune reaction induced by the exposure to an allergen that caused the asthma attack in a patient. 

Cytokines and chemokines are released, however this takes time and so occurs several hours after the initial early phase of the attack. They cause airway sensitivity and hyperreactivity, leading to wheezing, coughing, and bronchospasms.
