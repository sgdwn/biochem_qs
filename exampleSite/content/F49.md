summary: "Antibody diversity is primarily generated through junctional diversity in the CDR3 region, where the TdT enzyme adds or removes nucleotides from V, D, and J gene segments."

Antibody diversity mostly arises through junctional diversity. The enzyme terminal deoxynucleotide transferase (TdT) adds / removes up to 12 nucleotides from the beginning and end of each V D J segment. This mostly occurs in the CDR3 region.
