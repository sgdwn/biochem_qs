summary: "Variolation and vaccination are methods of inducing immunity against diseases like smallpox, with variolation using weakened pus from infected individuals and vaccination employing related, less dangerous pathogens like cowpox."

Variolation was an early form of vaccination that was developed in China and the Middle East. By taking pus from infected individuals, it was possible to attenuate the pathogen by exposing it to the sun. The attenuated pus could then be introduced to a new patient through a cut. This was not terribly effective, but had more favourable survival rates than being infected by the disease. Lady Montagu is regarded as bringing the technique to Western Europe. However, the weaker sunlight (reducing the attenuation processes efficacy) at higher latitudes reduced variolation’s efficacy compared to not being variolated. 

Vaccination was developed by Edward Jenner in the 1800s. Using a related, but less deadly, pathogen to smallpox, Jenner was able to prevent serious infection. This was discovered through observing that individuals infected with cowpox did not get smallpox – this is due to the relation between the two pathogens conveying immunity to each other. This is the principle that is used today, where a less deadly form of the pathogen (either inactivated / killed / or a subunit) can be used to protect people against the wild type.
