The hydride transfer onto the nicotinamide ring of NAD(P) can be used to determine the substrate binding site in the enzyme, through the angle of attack of the hydride group â€“ this is affected by the functional groups on the enzyme.  

The enzyme catalysing the hydride transfer is able to distinguish between the two states: NAD(P) and NAD(P)H.
