Ensuring the correct assays are selected when designing an experiment is important. If it is not possible to access the equipment required, then the reaction cannot be quantified.  

The assay must also be sensitive enough to detect the changes in the reaction. If a spectrophotometer is used, reactions with low concentrations or small volumes may not produce a large enough change to allow detection by the device.
