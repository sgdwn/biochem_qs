Peptide bonds are between the c-terminal of one amino acid and the n-terminal of the neighbouring one. These C-N bonds have a partial double bond character, suggesting the N is sp2 hybridised. This prevents rotation through the bond, allowing the protein to fold correctly.  

However, as there is not a pi bond on the C-N peptide bond, it can be considered planar. This is because only a sigma bond is present.
