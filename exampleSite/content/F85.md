summary: "Vaccinating against complex pathogens like HIV and malaria is difficult due to their high mutation rates and/or complex lifestyles, requiring the identification of stable antigens for effective vaccine development."

Complex pathogens, such as HIV or malaria (Plasmodium falciparum), are challenging to vaccinate against. This can be because of high mutation rates (in the case of HIV and malaria), or complex lifestyles (such as the vector-borne transmission that malaria exploits). 

Developing a vaccine that is able to accommodate the changing pathogen is challenging. Finding suitable targets to develop immunity against requires the identification of antigens that are less likely to evolve (and thus make the vaccine ineffective).
