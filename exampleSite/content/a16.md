Bortezomib is a protease inhibitor, using the boron atom to allow it to transition between trigonal and tetrahedral geometries. This structural change allows bortezomib to change its structure, allowing it to inhibit the action of the protease. As it is unable to be released once bound, bortezomib permanently prevents the protease activity â€“ hence it is a suicide inhibitor.
