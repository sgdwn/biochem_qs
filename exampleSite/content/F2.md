summary: "Prions are infectious proteins that propagate by inducing misfolding in other proteins, potentially transmitting between organisms through consumption and replicating through a catalytic subunit separation."

Prions are small proteins capable of inducing misfolding in other proteins, preventing them from functioning correctly. Prions are able to transmit to other organisms through the consumption of infected meat and animal products, potentially inducing misfolding in human proteins. 

Prions are infectious, capable of propagating through populations. Replication of prions is caused by the dimer protein separating, catalysing the formation of more prion subunits.
