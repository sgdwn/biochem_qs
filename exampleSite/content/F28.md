summary: "Interferons are signaling proteins produced in response to viral infections that inhibit viral replication and modulate the immune system through various mechanisms, including RNA degradation and translation downregulation for type I interferons, and immune cell activation for type II interferons."

Interferons are synthesised by cells in anticipation of viral infection, or in response to viral infection. They act by interfering with viral replication. 

Type I interferons are released by cells infected with a virus, alerting surrounding cells to the issue. When a cell detects type I interferon, it expresses an endoribonuclease and protein kinase A. This endoribonuclease degrades viral RNA, while protein kinase A phosphorylates eIF2, globally downregulating translation. This inhibits viral infection, allowing the immune system to respond and eliminate infected cells. 

Type II interferons modulate the immune response, and are only expressed by neutrophils, NK cells, and T cells. This allows macrophage activation, combating intracellular infections.
