summary: "Eosinophils release toxic substances to combat parasites and trigger inflammation, which can also occur in allergic reactions like asthma."
---
Eosinophils secrete toxic proteins and free-radicals in response to parasite infections, causing localised inflammation. Inflammation aims to cause the parasite to detach from the self-tissue, hopefully resolving the infection. May also damage the parasite causing it to die?
Eosinophil activation can occur in allergy responses, such as asthma.
