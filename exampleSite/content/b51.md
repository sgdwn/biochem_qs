Virulence factors are essential in bacterial pathogenesis, allowing the pathogen to invade and cause damage to its host.  

For a pathogen to colonise its host, it may employ adhesins, invasins, siderophores, and chemotaxis.  

To cause damage to the host, the pathogen may use toxins, proteases, DNases, haemolysins, ... These cause pain to the host, causing side effects (diarrhoea, ...). 

The presence of virulence factors determines whether an infected individual will be asymptomatic or symptomatic. If virulence factors are absent, the patient will likely be asymptomatic.
