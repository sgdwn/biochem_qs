summary: "Hypervariable regions, particularly complementarity determining regions (CDRs), are key parts of antibody genes that define antigen specificity and can be engineered to alter the antibody's target."
---
Hypervariable regions are sections of the antibody gene that convey most/all of the specificity an antibody has for its target antigen/epitope. These regions include the complementarity determining regions (CDR), which are short sections of sequence that determine the binding interaction with the antigen. There are three CDRs in an antibody, and they can be engineered to modify the antibodyâ€™s target.
