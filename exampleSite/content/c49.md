Schizophrenia is a genetic condition that begins its presentation in utero. It isn’t a single gene disorder, but instead hundreds of risk genes have been identified through genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Increased cannabis consumption during an individual’s adolescent years causes the symptoms to have an earlier onset. 
Increased dopamine signalling leads to stronger positive symptoms. 

Genetic: the risk alleles identified through GWAS, that have an association with the development of schizophrenia

Environmental: cannabis consumption during an individuals adolescent years makes the onset of the symptoms earlier and stronger.
