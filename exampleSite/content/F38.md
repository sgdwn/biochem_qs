summary: "Somatic hypermutation introduces targeted mutations in B cells to improve antibody binding specificity through affinity maturation, enhancing the immune response."

Somatic hypermutation occurs where mutations are formed in somatic B cells, at a much higher rate than would otherwise be expected. Introducing these mutations into B cells is catalysed by enzymes which target complementarity determining regions (CDRs). It is not known how mutation is focused exclusively on these regions.

Somatic hypermutation is used to improve the binding specificity of an antigen, through a process called affinity maturation. It tends to occur after B cell activation, enabling natural selection to pick the B cell producing the most specific antibody without producing many B cells that all produce very similar antibodies. 

Improving the binding efficiency of the antibody is important, allowing more specific binding to the target epitope. This prevents off-target effects.
