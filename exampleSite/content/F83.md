summary: "Lipid nanoparticles are essential for the effectiveness of mRNA vaccines by protecting the mRNA and facilitating its delivery into target cells."

Lipid nanoparticles (LNP) are important to package the mRNA in mRNA vaccines, protecting it from rapid degradation and enabling the mRNA to be taken up by target cells. This allows mRNA vaccines to be administered efficiently. Without LNP packaging, mRNA vaccines would be ineffective at vaccinating the patient.
