_Myxococcus xanthus_ is a good model organism to study, with its large genome conveying many different features that are normally only found in higher organisms. _M. xanthus_ is capable of forming biofilms, developmental differentiation, type IV pili and bacterial motor systems, prokaryotic signalling, and biological pest control.  

_M. xanthus_ is also a highly social bacteria, exhibiting altruistic behaviour. It is able to form swarms, predate other bacterium, and show coordinated behaviour.  

_Myxococcus_ is also capable of spore formation, allowing fruiting body processes to be understood.  

The wide range of genetic features makes _M. xanthus_ a good model organism for studying many processes.
