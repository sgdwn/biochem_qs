summary: "Inflammasomes enable a rapid and reliable immune response to intracellular pathogens by processing pre-synthesized pro-cytokines into active cytokines, especially when global translation is downregulated during infection."

The inflammasome is a protein body required for the processing of pro-cytokines. This is a necessary process to allow active cytokines to be released from a cell. 

By synthesising a precursor to cytokines, the cell can rapidly convert the inactive form into the active cytokine. This allows a quick response to pathogen presence, especially intracellular pathogens that are detected by NOD-like receptors (NLR). 

During an intracellular infection, global translation may be downregulated (especially if type II interferon is present). This would make expressing sufficient quantities of cytokine challenging, and so a simple conversion of pre-expressed molecules is much more reliable. Reliability is necessary to ensure the immune system is activated to bring the infection under control.
