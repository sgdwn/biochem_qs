summary: "T cell activation requires three signals: antigen presentation by MHC, co-stimulation via CD28-B7 interaction to prevent uncontrolled activation, and cytokine signaling to direct T cell differentiation."

Co-stimulatory molecules are molecules required in combination with an antigen to activate a T cell. There are three different ‘signals’ required to successfully activate a T cell. 

Signal 1 is MHC. The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) is a cell-surface protein used to present antigenic peptides to the T cell. If MHC is not present, the T cell cannot be activated. 

Signal 2 prevents uncontrolled T cell activation. CD28 on the T cell interacts with B7 on the antigen-presenting cell, allowing confirmation that the T cell should be activated. This co-stimulation mechanism is especially important with naive T cells, preventing unwanted activation. 

Signal 3 is given by cytokines, helping the T cell differentiate into a subtype (TH1, TH2, TH17, T regulatory, T follicular helper, …). This supports the diversity and specificity of the immune response.
