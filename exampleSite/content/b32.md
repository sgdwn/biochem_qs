Carboxysomes are proteinaceous organelles found in cyanobacteria, forming 3-phosphoglycerate from CO2 and RuBP. These micro-compartments allow the exclusion of O2, which is important in maintaining the efficiency of the reaction. If oxygen is present, rubisco can cause photorespiration – the division of carbonic anhydrase and rubisco from the cytoplasm is important to prevent wasted energy.  

Introducing carboxysomes into plant chloroplasts could improve the rate of reaction, providing more energy for growth. Having more energy could increase crop yields, give faster growth, and help provide more food for Earth’s population.
