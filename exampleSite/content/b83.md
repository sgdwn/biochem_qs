Pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) are an important component in the innate immune, allowing cells to recognise and respond to microbe associated molecular patterns (Mamps, also called Pamps).  

By detecting the presence of common patterns found on microbes, a cell-mediated response (such as phagocytosis) can occur. Subsequently, other parts of the immune system can be activated through the release of cytokines and chemokines â€“ these allow chemotaxis, recruiting more immune cells to the site of infection. 

LPS, dsRNA, lipoteichoic acid are all patterns (Mamps) that can be recognised by PRRs. These molecules are present in a wide range of pathogens, enabling a non-specific initial response as part of the innate immune system. This increases the speed at which a response can be mounted to a pathogen, potentially allowing the infection to be resolved before it becomes a larger problem.
