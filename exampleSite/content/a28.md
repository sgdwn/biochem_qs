RNA self-cleavage is possible in alkaline conditions, with the 2â€™ OH group being the source of the attacking nucleophile. This cleaves the phosphodiester bond, taking up a H+ from the water.  

A pentaphosphate intermediate is formed, allowing the bond from the phosphate group to the nucleobase to be broken. This is because phosphate cannot support 5 bonds.
