Affinity maturation is an important process used in the development of B cells, allowing antibody with greater specificity for its target to be synthesised. Through somatic recombination and hypermutation, changes in the variable region occur, allowing natural selection pressures to favour the more specific antibody.  

Through affinity maturation, a stronger and more specific adaptive immune response can be formed against a specific antigen.
