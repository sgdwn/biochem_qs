STI cases are increasing due to relaxed attitudes by sexually active individuals towards these infections. As it is possible to prevent pregnancy with hormonal contraceptives, some individuals forgo barrier contraception. This allows STIs to transmit between individuals during intimate contact.  

Online dating apps have increased the number of sexual partners an individual may have, leading to more chances for infection. Higher numbers of partners increases the chances of an infected individual spreading their infection to many others.  

The use of drugs such as sildenafil allows individuals to remain sexually active as they age. This has led to elderly populations being the largest growth group for STIs.
