summary: "IgM more efficiently activates the classical complement pathway than IgG due to its pentameric structure and higher avidity for antigens, which facilitates C1q binding."

The complement system is part of the innate immune system that can be activated by antigen-antibody binding. Through the classical pathway, C3 convertase is produced by C1q binding to antibodies that have bound antigen. C1q catalyses the formation of C2 and C4, which produce C3 convertase. This activates the complement system. 

IgM is a pentameric antibody, and has 10 antigen binding sites. This allows strong interactions to be formed with the pathogen, and allows more flexibility in the positioning of the antigen. This reduces the amount of IgM that needs to bind to the pathogen for C1q to be able to bind. 

IgG is monomeric, and has 2 antigen binding sites. To activate C1q, more IgG must bind, and the binding must be the correct distance apart. If these criteria are not satisfied, C1q will not be able to bind, preventing the activation of complement via the classical pathway. It may still be possible for complement to be activated via the alternative or MB-lectin binding pathways.
