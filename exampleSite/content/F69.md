summary: "γδ T cells, unlike the more common αβ T cells, can recognize antigens without MHC presentation, allowing for recognition of diverse molecules and bridging innate and adaptive immunity."
---
γδ T cells are a less common type of T cell (around 1-5% of all T cells) that are able to recognise antigen without requiring it to be presented by an MHC molecule. This allows more flexibility in the immune response, allowing non-protein molecules to be recognised more easily, such as lipids and phosphorylated antigens. This is important in linking adaptive and innate immunity together. 

αβ T cells are the dominant type of T cell present, and require MHC to present antigenic material for recognition.
