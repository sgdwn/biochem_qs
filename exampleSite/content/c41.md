A partial seizure only affects one region of the brain, having a localised effect. For example, this could be spasms of the hand muscles. 
A generalised seizure is much more serious, with the whole brain experiencing synchronous and rhythmic excitation. This leads to the entire body spasming, and results in brain damage as the activity continues. 

These seizures are different, with generalised ones spreading to both hemispheres of the brain.
