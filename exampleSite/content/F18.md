summary: "Natural killer cells are innate immune cells that identify and kill infected or cancerous "altered self" cells by inducing apoptosis through the release of perforin and granzymes, ensuring a clean death that prevents further infection spread."

Natural killer (NK) cells are the only innate immune cell of lymphoid lineage. By using MHC I receptors on their cell surface, NK cells can identify ‘altered self’ cells that may be problematic (eg- infected by an intracellular bacteria, viral infection, cancer, …) and target them. During these types of infection, MHC I protein expression levels tend to change in a cell, allowing NK cells to target them.
Once an NK cell identifies an ‘altered’ target cell, it begins to secrete perforin. This enzyme forms pores across the cell membrane of the target. Cytoplasmic granules are then localised to the pole of the NK cell with the pores into the target cell. The contents of these granules are then released into the target cell, inducing apoptosis and leading to a ‘clean’ death. Granzymes are found within the granules.
Some intracellular bacteria can also have apoptosis induced by these granzymes. 
A clean death is where the cell undergoes apoptosis, with none of the contents leaving the cell. This is important in preventing the infection from being propagated by the immune system. 
Have the ability to kill some intracellular bacteria.
