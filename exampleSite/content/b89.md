Pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) are important in the innate immune response, allowing pathogens to be recognised. Microbe associated molecular patterns (Mamps) are conserved structures found across a wide range of pathogens, and include LPS, dsRNA, and lipoteichoic acid. As these patterns are found almost exclusively on pathogens, the immune system can mount a response while reducing the risk of targeting a self-cell.
