Biotin carries CO2 molecules, playing an important role in all cellular reactions involving CO2 (such as pyruvate carboxylase). Due to the ease with which CO2 is lost from reaction sites, it is important to have a larger molecule to bind it to, preventing it from diffusing away. 

Biotin cannot be synthesised de novo by human cells, and so must be absorbed from dietary sources.
