summary: "Phagocytosis is a process where cells engulf and degrade foreign material to fight infection, although some pathogens can exploit this process for their own survival."

Phagocytosis is the process of engulfing and degrading foreign or unwanted cells. By degrading pathogens, it is possible to kill and remove them, preventing further replication and helping to resolve an infection. 
When the pathogen is engulfed, it is enclosed in a phagosome. Lysozyme enzymes are released into the phagosome, breaking down proteins and lipid membranes, leading to the death of the pathogen. The products of this process are released into the extracellular environment. 
Some bacteria can exploit phagocytosis, such as legionella bacteria. Legionella is capable of growing in the phagosome, inserting proteins preventing the fusion of lysosomes with the phagosome.
