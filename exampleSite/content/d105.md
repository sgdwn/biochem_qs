Retinal is the chromophore found within bacteriorhodopsin, containing a polyene tail. On this polyene tail, a delocalised electron system is found, allowing retinal to change colour in its different isomerisations. 

Excitation of retinal by a photon allows it to isomerise at C13. This isomerisation changes the colour reflected, allowing the bacteriorhodopsin pumping cycle to be followed visually.
