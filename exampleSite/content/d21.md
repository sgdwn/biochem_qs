Chemiosmotic theory describes the movement of ions across a semi-permeable membrane. 

Peter Mitchell stated that a proton motive force is responsible for storing energy. Mitchell demonstrated this through the Jagendorf acid-bath experiment. This experiment demonstrated that protons would move down the concentration gradient, and this was observed by the change in pH across the cell membrane, with protons transporting through ATP synthase enzymes.
