Non-replicative transposition occurs with DNA transposons. These transposons are excised from one location in the genome, and inserted into another location, by the enzyme transposase (tnpA). 

This process can be used to produce mutant libraries through the random insertion of transposons to disrupt genes. By conducting a transposon-mediated differential hybridisation screen (TMDH), it is possible to identify genes essential for cell survival. Chaudhuri et al. used this to identify genes causing virulence factors in Salmonella typhimurium. This has applications in live attenuated vaccines.
