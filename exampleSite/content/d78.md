The H+ gradient is integral to ATP synthesis, providing the driving force for ATP synthase. Without the proton gradient, it would not be possible to provide the conformational change required for the catalytic activity of ATP synthase. 

The pH outside the membrane must be lower than inside, to allow protons to flow through the ATP synthase down the concentration gradient. A higher concentration of protons outside the membrane would give a lower concentration.
