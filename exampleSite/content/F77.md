summary: "Adjuvants like MatrixM and aluminum salts enhance the immune response to weakly immunogenic antigens in vaccines."

Adjuvants can be an important component of vaccines, allowing stronger immune responses to be elicited against poor immunogens (antigens that donâ€™t activate the immune system very well). Adjuvants can include MatrixM and aluminium salts.
