summary: "Antibody function, determined by its class, is dictated by its structure comprising variable Fab arms for antigen binding and constant Fc and Fab regions for immune component recognition."

Antibody function is heavily influenced by their structure. 

Antibodies are formed of two main sections: the Fc domain (fragment crystallisable) and the Fab arms (fragment antigen binding). Fc is constant across an antibody class, allowing the antibody to be recognised by other immune components, such as C1q for the classical activation of the complement pathway. Fab contains the variable domains and binding arms, allowing recognition of the antibodyâ€™s corresponding antigen and its epitope. 

There are 2 types of domain within an antibody: variable and constant. As implied by the name, the variable domain is the part of the antibody that controls binding to the antigen and recognition of the epitope. The constant domain consists of half the Fab arm, and the entire Fc domain, allowing recognition by other immune components, and conveying the structure to the antibody (including the class).

The class of antibody is determined by the constant domains, and the class determines the biological function of the antibody. For example, IgM is used to combat parasite infection by inducing inflammation at the target site. This also supports the recruitment of other immune cells through chemotaxis.
