The modular structure of transcription factors allows the expression of many different transcription factors dependent on alternative splicing. This allows protein isoforms to be expressed, giving greater specificity to the transcription factor needed. 

This modularity was discovered through deletion analysis, in a similar way to promoter mutational analysis. This allowed the observation of a modular domain structure, which could be modified easily.
