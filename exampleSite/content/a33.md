It is unusual for uracil to be incorporated into DNA, or thymine into RNA during natural synthesis. This is because the two bases have different molecular structure, preventing the polymerases from incorporating the different bases. 

Phosphodiester bonds are formed between the nucleotide sugar and phosphate groups in DNA, allowing a polynucleotide to be formed. These bonds are very stable, preventing the autocatalytic hydrolysis of DNA molecules.
