summary: "Mast cells are long-lived, tissue-resident immune cells that act as sentinels, releasing inflammatory mediators upon detecting pathogens or immune signals to enhance immune cell recruitment and fight infection."

Mast cells are found in tissues, and are ‘sentinel’. This describes their ability to detect infections, especially around mucosal membranes. 

By releasing inflammatory mediators on detecting IgM, IgG, C3b, and C5a binding, immune activation can take place. Inflammatory mediators make extravasation of further immune cells easier by increasing the sinusoidal nature of capillaries, improving the response at the site of infection. 

Due to mast cells’ resident location in tissue, they are always waiting to detect an infection. They have a long life-span, ensuring mast cells remain in place even in the absence of infection / activation.
