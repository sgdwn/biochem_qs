Cumulative control of an enzyme is the process of using many different products to inhibit an enzyme. This allows an enzyme involved in many different metabolic pathways to be controlled by the subsequent products. 

Glutamine synthetase is an example of cumulative control, being inhibited by the many different products of the subsequent reactions it catalyses, including ATP and amino acids.
