Quaternary protein structure is a structure seen in proteins consisting of multiple individual proteins bound together in a complex. 
The individual constituent proteins may all be identical, as is the case in homo-oligomers, or there may be different subunits (hetero-oligomers). Haemoglobin is a hetero-oligomer, being formed from heam a and haem b.
