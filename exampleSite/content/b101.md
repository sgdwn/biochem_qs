Gonorrhoea is transmitted by contact with body fluids, such as infected semen or blood, on intimate mucosal surfaces (such as the vagina, urethral mucosa, and throat).  

In females, gonorrhoea infection can cause pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). This is a very painful infection that can cause damage to the fallopian tubes and ultimately lead to infertility.  

In males, a thick urethral discharge is normally observed, along with pain on urination.  

Around half of all cases are asymptomatic, and many present only mild symptoms.
