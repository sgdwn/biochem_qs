NAD(P)H is used by beta-ketoacyl reductase in the fatty acid biosynthesis elongation cycle. This allows the removal of â€“OH groups, forming a double bond in the fatty acid chain, while releasing an NAD(P)+ and a water molecule.  

Enoyl reductase is able to reduce the double bond formed, if necessary, by adding hydrogens either side.
