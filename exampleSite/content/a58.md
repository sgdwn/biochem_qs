A pH-stat maintains a constant pH in a reaction, by adding an appropriate volume of alkali or acid to counteract any change in pH. By coupling a pH probe to a pump, the H+ concentration can be maintained.  

Maintaining a constant pH is important in some experiments, especially enzyme-catalysed reactions. Changes in pH could lead to an enzyme denaturing, or reactants not being in the physiological form, preventing successful study.
