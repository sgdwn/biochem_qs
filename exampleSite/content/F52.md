summary: "AID is an enzyme that induces mutations and class switching in B cells by modifying DNA, and its dysregulation can lead to immunodeficiencies or leukemia."
---
AID catalyses modifications to the genome in B cells, converting cytosines to uracils. This activates a DNA repair pathway, inducing a mutation in the genome. In the variable regions, base-excision and mismatch repair can be used to induce these mutations – this is important in somatic hypermutation. 

If these modifications are made in the switch sequences, class switching is normally induced. If AID is dysfunctional, immunodeficiencies can occur. This is mainly caused by an inability to synthesise any antibody but IgM (making strong humoral responses impossible). If AID is overactive, leukaemia can be induced – it’s therefore important to tightly regulate the activity of the enzyme.
