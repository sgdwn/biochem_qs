Selecting targets to study for drug discovery is an important process, eliminating those with low probabilities of success. 
Using ligand binding assays, the affinity of a ligand can be determined in vitro, allowing the identification of whether a ligand has potential as a drug. 

It is important to identify the correct receptor, enzyme, or transport protein, to ensure the intended effect is obtained. If the wrong target is selected, undesired effects may occur, as well as wasting time and resources.
