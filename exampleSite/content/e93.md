Heterochromatin spreading is the process of condensing DNA in a wave-like pattern, along its length. This allows an autocatalytic process to occur, forming heterochromatin in linear pattern from a focus. 

Gene insulators are regulatory proteins, restricting the spread of heterochromatin into actively transcribed regions, as well as regulatory elements (silencers, enhancers, â€¦). By being able to define the boundaries of actively transcribed genes, it is possible to have heterochromatic and euchromatic regions on a single chromosome.
