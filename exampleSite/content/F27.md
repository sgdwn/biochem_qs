summary: "Inflammatory mediators trigger inflammation by increasing blood flow, capillary permeability, and immune cell migration, leading to swelling and potentially systemic effects like fever."

Inflammatory mediators are molecules that induce inflammation. Generally, inflammation is localised, although in some circumstances the inflammation can be systemic / chronic. 

Inflammatory mediators make capillaries more sinusoidal, allowing immune cells to migrate out of the blood into the surrounding tissue (through the process of extravasation). This has the side effect of allowing more fluid out of the blood, causing the swelling often seen with inflammation. 
Increased blood flow raises the temperature of that area. This is beneficial, as some immune cells are more active at a slightly elevated temperature. A systemic fever can be induced by the hypothalamus becoming inflamed, raising body temperature throughout the organism. 

Inflammatory mediators are vital to inducing inflammation.
