MDR gonorrhoea infection is a more prevalent issue, making Neisseria gonorrhoeae infection more difficult to treat with the available antibiotics. The drug-resistance seen here is likely due to excessive antibiotic use and poor prescribing.  

Novel antibiotics could be developed to allow MDR gonorrhoea infections to be treated, however any new antibiotic developed now will most likely be available only for the most life-threatening bacterial infections. Encouraging the use of barrier contraceptives would reduce the spread of gonorrhoea, and using public health orders on individuals with known MDR infections could also be used.  

Ensuring sexually active individuals get tested frequently for STIs is also important, allowing infections to be resolved correctly. It is also important that patients of sexual health clinics continue to engage with their treatments to ensure infections are resolved successfully.
