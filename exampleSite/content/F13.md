summary: "The complement system defends against pathogens through direct lysis via the membrane attack complex, recruitment and activation of immune cells, opsonization, and stimulation of adaptive immune responses."
---
Activation of the complement system induces the formation of the membrane attack complex (MAC) through C9 polymerisation. The MAC inserts into the bacterial membrane, producing a pore and causing the contents of the bacteria to leak out. This kills the bacteria. MAC insertion is not effective against Gram-positive bacteria, due to the thicker layer of peptidoglycan. 
Complement is also able to act as a chemoattractant to immune cells, recruiting cells such as macrophages to the site of infection. C3b is an anaphylatoxin, inducing inflammation at the site of infection. This stimulates B cells to synthesise antibodies. Complement proteins can opsonise a pathogen, recruiting phagocytic cells to the target cells. 
Antigen-presenting cells can also be stimulated by complement activation, allowing adaptive immune responses to be induced more quickly.
