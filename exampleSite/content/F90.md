summary: "Genetically engineered mice with humanized antibody genes enable rapid production of human antibodies for research, although this method raises ethical concerns and requires specialized facilities compared to cell cultures."

Transgenic mice are genetically modified mice that are used in research. In terms of antibody production, the antibody genes in mice can be replaced with human genes. This allows the production of human antibodies in mice – a xenoprotein (to the mouse). 

It’s advantageous to use engineered mice to allow antibodies to be synthesised quickly. B cells can be recovered from the mouse following the infection (memory cells), and processed in vitro to enable monoclonal antibody synthesis. 

Some people have ethical objections to the use of mammalian organisms in research, and may have qualms about synthesising antibodies in this way. It’s more challenging to look after mice compared to cell cultures, as highly specialised facilities are required, along with trained technicians to look after the animals in line with legislation.
