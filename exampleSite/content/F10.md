summary: "The immune system is divided into humoral immunity, which uses soluble factors like antibodies and cytokines, and cell-mediated immunity, which utilizes immune cells like macrophages to activate other immune components."

Humoral immunity encompasses the components of the immune system that are soluble factors (antibodies are secreted) - found in the body’s ‘humors’. This division of the immune system includes antibodies and cytokines. 
Cell-mediated immunity involves immune cells, such as (leukocytes) macrophages, monocytes, and natural killer cells. This division only contains cells, and does not rely on antibodies. Cell-mediated responses induce the synthesis of cytokines, activating more components of the innate and adaptive immune system.
