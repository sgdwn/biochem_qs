title: "Discuss the application of bio-photovoltaics using cyanobacteria to convert light into electricity. How does the process of transferring electrons from the photosynthesis electron transport chain to an electrode work, and what are the challenges in scaling up this technology for practical use? "

Electron transfer from the photosynthetic electron transport chain to an electrode is not well understood.  

This process has been demonstrated in small-scale models, however modern silicon-based photovoltaics are incredibly cheap and efficient, so have dominated. Perhaps if there are shortages of silicon and other components in the future the development of bio-photovoltaics will receive more funding.
