summary: "IgE, acting as a backup to IgA beneath the skin, triggers the release of inflammatory mediators from mast cells upon binding to allergens via Fc receptors."

IgE is thought to act as a backup to IgA, and is found beneath the skin. Through interaction with mast cells, IgE can induce the release of inflammatory mediators (histamine, heparin, â€¦), if IgE binds to an allergen. Fc receptors mediate the binding of IgE to mast cells.
