summary: "Dysfunctional complement regulation, stemming from deficiencies in CD46 and CD59 or suppression of the C3b tick-over mechanism, can lead to autoimmune conditions and impaired immune responses."
---
Deficiencies in complement regulation can lead to self cells being targeted. CD46 is an inhibitory protein found on the surface of self-cells, inducing cleavage of C3 and C4 proteins to inhibit the activation of complement. 
CD59 is another protein found exclusively on the surface of self-cells, sequestering complement protein C9 to prevent polymerisation and formation of the membrane attack complex (MAC). This sequestration prevents the lysis of self-cells. 
A tick-over mechanism for complement activation is used in the alternative activation pathway. By constantly producing C3b, the rest of the pathway is constantly expressed, allowing rapid upregulation on detecting the presence of a pathogen. 

Dysregulation of the expression of CD46 and CD59 can result in immunopathologies and autoimmune conditions. Suppressing the tick-over mechanism will slow complement responses, making it more challenging to bring infections back under control.
