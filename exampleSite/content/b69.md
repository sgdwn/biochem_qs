RNR, ribonucleotide reductase, is the enzyme catalysing the synthesis of dNTPs. It is expressed under feedback inhibition, with high concentrations of dNTP inhibiting its translation. The DnaA-ATP concentration also inhibits RNR expression, ensuring there is adequate RNR in the cell when DNA replication occurs.  

Primase is inhibited by low nutrients in the cell, inhibiting division where the environmental status is not favourable.  

If there are inadequate nutrients present, the bacterium should not divide as there may not be adequate energy in the cell for survival with 2 of them. Therefore, DNA replication would not be the best survival decision to make.
