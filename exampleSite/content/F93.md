summary: "Antibodies can be engineered to specifically target and destroy cancer cells through various mechanisms, including direct drug delivery and immune system activation, due to their high binding specificity and ability to target unique protein conformations."

Antibodies can be used to treat cancers by binding to antigens found only on the surface of the cancer cell. An antibody that binds to the specific epitope can be designed rationally, allowing its expression in hybridoma cells. 

Due to antibody molecules being large, modifications can be made. These can include conjugating a drug molecule to the antibody, allowing the activity of chemotherapy to be restricted solely to the cancer cells. Antibodies can also be used to opsonise cells, marking them for destruction by the immune system.

Antibodies have highly specific binding, with an almost infinite number of possible conformations of target epitopes available. This makes it possible to target specific conformations of proteins, enabling the specificity that is required by a drug to prevent off-target effects.
