Triclosan is a competitive inhibitor of ENR, inserting between aromatic side chains in the orthosteric (active) site. This allows the molecule to prevent the binding of the normal substrate, and thus the bacteria die. Resistance to triclosan has been observed, but it requires bulky mutation to the active site, and this can reduce the catalytic activity of the enzyme.  

Diazaborine is also a competitive inhibitor to ENR, inserting into the active site with NAD and preventing fatty acid synthesis. As diazaborine molecules have more specific binding to ENR, they are more easily inhibited – simple, individual mutations are adequate to restore enzyme function. It was for this reason that research into using diazaborine molecules as narrow-spectrum antibiotics was suspended – resistance developed far too easily (and they contain a boron atom, which had severe side effects of brain damage and death).
