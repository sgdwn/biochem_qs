A 8 C-subunit Fo rotor has a much higher efficiency than a 14 C-subunit ring, due to there being 6 fewer H+ ions required to synthesise 3 ATPs with an 8 subunit ring. 
Fewer C-subunits are typically found in animals, which have a more stable supply of energy than plants (which have more C-subunits).
