Primary active transport is a form of active transport directly linking the hydrolysis of ATP to transport, allowing the uptake of a substance against the concentration gradient. 

ATPases catalyse the hydrolysis of ATP, allowing the movement of a substrate. This involves a conformational change to the protein, allowing the substrate to be moved against the gradient, by alternating the access the substrate binding site has access to.
