summary: "TNF is a dual-edged sword, beneficial in fighting infection by inducing fever and clotting but harmful in high concentrations, leading to sepsis, organ failure, and hypotension."

TNF helps combat infection by causing fever. Fever raises body temperature to the optimal for certain immune responses (39.5 °C for T and B cell activation). TNF also increases blood clotting, preventing the spread of infection.
TNF can cause damage where its concentration is too high, leading to sepsis and organ failure or death. High TNF concentrations (>1 μg/mL) increase the permeability of capillaries, causing more fluid to move out and blood pressure to drop (hypotension).
