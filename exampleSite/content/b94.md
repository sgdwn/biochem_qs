Regulatory T cells are involved in suppressing the immune response against self or microbiota-derived responses. By secreting IL-10, T helper cell activity is suppressed, reducing the immune response and preventing the killing of self-cells. Regulatory T cells also prevent immune responses to commensal bacteria, such as those found in the GI microbiota.
