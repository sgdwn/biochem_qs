summary: "Vaccines utilize various strategies, including weakened pathogens, inactivated pathogens, pathogen components, or genetic material, to stimulate an immune response and provide protection against disease, with varying degrees of effectiveness and safety."

Attenuated vaccines consist of a weakened version of the pathogen, allowing it to be injected directly into the patient, whose immune system will resolve the infection and develop strong, long-lasting immunity. Weakened pathogens can be obtained through serial passaging, an in vitro technique where the pathogen is grown in cell culture conditions outside of its normal range. This causes the pathogen to evolve away from the original form, becoming more effective at growing in the modified conditions – leading to the pathogen becoming less effective at growing in humans, and thus making it much easier for the immune system to combat the infection. More modern approaches can be used with attenuated vaccines, allowing virulence genes to be specifically removed. This makes the development of a weaker pathogen easier, removing the time consuming process of serial passaging. 

Killed/inactivated pathogen vaccines consist of the original pathogen in a dead state. This allows the patient to be exposed to the real pathogen, without the risk of an infection occurring. Additional processes have been added to the manufacture of inactivated pathogen vaccines to reduce the risk of the inactivation process failing (as occurred with a batch of polio vaccine), helping to improve their safety. Inactivated vaccines are very effective, but are less effective than attenuated vaccines due to their inability to replicate. This lack of replication is different to the immune response of a true infection, and is not possible to do with a dead pathogen. 

Subunit vaccines contain specific components from the original pathogen, but do not contain the pathogen. This allows an immune response to be elicited without the risk of accidental infection. There are many different types of subunit vaccines: conjugate, RNA, DNA, adeno-associated virus, … Most types of subunit vaccine require the use of an adjuvant to obtain the strong immune response required for immunity to develop – this could include MatrixM or aluminium salts. However, even with an adjuvant, immunity from many types of subunit vaccine is still weaker than attenuated or inactivated pathogen vaccines. 
Recently, RNA vaccines have become more popular. These deliver the genetic material encoding an antigen from the pathogen to human cells, allowing the protein to be expressed in the patient. This seems to give longer lasting immunity that is as effective as the traditional vaccine technologies (attenuated, inactivated). Adjuvants do not need to be used here.
