Voltage-gated K+ channels have an additional subunit, found within the membrane. Containing charged arginine residues allowing its movement in response to the transmembrane potential, a linker loop allows the transfer of this flexion to the channel subunit.
As the transmembrane voltage changes, the voltage-sensing subunit moves up and down, acting as a level on the channel. This allows the control of the opening of the pore. 

This allows the control of ion transport, allowing the K+ channel to act as a biological transistor.
