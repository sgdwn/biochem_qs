summary: "MHC I and MHC II present endogenous and exogenous peptides, respectively, to cytotoxic and helper T cells, triggering different immune responses."
---
MHC I presents endogenous peptides to cytotoxic T cells. For example, viral proteins can be presented on MHC I by being cleaved into a short peptide, bound to MHC I, and transported to the membrane. This allows cytotoxic T cells to identify any foreign peptides and kill cells that are producing them. 
When the immunoproteasome is upregulated, such as during viral infection, proteins are cleaved into short peptides that are the correct length for presentation on MHC I. MHC I is expressed by all cells.

MHC II presents exogenous peptides. This only occurs in macrophages, dendritic cells, and B cells. When an antigen is taken up into an endosome, it unfolds through acidification, and then undergoes proteolysis. This gives short peptides of the correct length for presentation by MHC II. MHC II is recognised by helper T cells, allowing the activation of the rest of the adaptive immune system to initiate a humoral (antibody) response.
