summary: "Neutrophils combat infection by migrating to affected tissues, engulfing pathogens via phagocytosis, or trapping and killing them with antimicrobial-laden DNA nets (NETosis), which also recruits additional immune cells."

Neutrophils are short lived innate immune cells that migrate towards tissues releasing chemoattractants â€“ things like C5a, C3b, IgA, and IgG. 

Once at the site of infection, neutrophils can engulf the pathogenic cells by phagocytosis. Alternatively, NETosis (neutrophil extracellular traps) can occur. This is where the neutrophil ejects DNA coated with antimicrobial compounds, wrapping the pathogenic cells. Although NETosis results in the death of the neutrophil, it helps bring the infection under control through the antimicrobial compounds on the DNA net, and through recruiting more immune cells to the site of infection.
