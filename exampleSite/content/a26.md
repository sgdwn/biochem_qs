Associative mechanisms involve the leaving group being lost before the nucleophile attacks. Dissociative mechanisms involve the nucleophile being added as the leaving group leaves.  

The probability of whether an associative or dissociative mechanism is used depends on what R group is present. Nucleic acids favour the associative mechanism.
