The Encyclopaedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) Project aimed to identify functional elements within the human genome. This included chromatin accessibility, histone modification, non-protein coding transcripts, amongst other elements. 
This research project identified approximately 80% of the human genome having biological function, a large increase on what was previously thought. This led to disagreement in the scientific community, due to it having a different definition of a ‘functional element’, as well as these elements having different levels of activity. The results from ENCODE are now widely accepted.
