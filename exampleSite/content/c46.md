There are three dopamine pathways in the brain:

Nigrostriatal
    Controls fine motor control, connecting the substantia nigra to the striatum. 
    
Mesolimbic and Mesocortical
    Connects the ventral tegmental area to the amygdala. Involved in feelings of euphoria, reward behaviour, mood, and pleasure. 
    
Tuberohypophyseal
    Connecting the hypothalamus to the pituitary. Controls pituitary hormone secretion - prolactin, â€¦.
