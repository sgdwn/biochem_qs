Half-life describes the concept of half the reactant being converted to product. This is calculated by ln(0.5)/k, giving the period of time as defined by the units of k. For example, the half-life of DNA is in the hundreds of years.  

A longer half-life can indicate a more stable molecule, or a slower reaction. This is beneficial with DNA, ensuring it is able to maintain its integrity over long periods of time.
