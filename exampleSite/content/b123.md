RNA thermometers exploit the changes in nucleotide binding over a range of temperatures, allowing gene expression to be regulated to specific temperatures. By modulating the secondary structure of the RNA, the accessibility of the Shine-Dalgarno sequence (ribosome binding site) changes, adjusting the probability of the ribosome binding to the mRNA transcript.  

This is not an all or nothing response, with melting occurring gradually over a range of temperatures.
