summary: "Eosinophils and neutrophils both combat pathogens using different strategies: eosinophils release toxic substances effective against large, multicellular pathogens, while neutrophils phagocytose pathogens or release antimicrobial DNA, which is less effective against larger pathogens."

Eosinophils release antimicrobial compounds in the area around pathogenic cells, including reactive oxygen species (ROS), cytoplasmic granules, and toxic proteins. They are not able to phagocytose cells. Therefore, they are more effective against multi-cellular pathogens that canâ€™t be dealt with by phagocytosis. 

Neutrophils are phagocytic cells, capable of taking up pathogenic cells. However, neutrophils can also eject antimicrobial-coated DNA through a process called NETosis. This allows them to deal with pathogens that are too large to phagocytose, although it is less effective than the strategies employed by eosinophils.
