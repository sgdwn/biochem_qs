Targeting Ndh and Cyd for antimicrobial drugs may have potential, as these proteins are only found in bacterial electron transport chains (allowing for selective toxicity). Inhibiting the function of these electron transport complexes may be harder to develop mutation against, due to the essential function of these proteins in aerobic respiration.
