Cyclo-oxygenase (Cox) enzymes are involved in the production of inflammatory mediators. This makes them an ideal target for inhibitors to reduce pain and swelling. 

The non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) class targets these Cox enzymes, with the range of drugs having varying affinity. Aspirin, one of the oldest synthetic drugs developed, targets Cox1, inhibiting its ability to produce inflammatory mediators. This allows it to have an analgesic and antipyretic effect, reducing pain and temperature. 

Cox enzymes are also involved in producing clotting factors. For this reason, Aspirin is also used as an anti-thrombotic in some countries (notably the US). Taking low-dose Aspirin is an effective way of reducing the risk of cardiac arrests and strokes, but is not the safest way of doing so. Therefore, in many countries, anti-thrombotic drugs, such as warfarin, are preferred.
