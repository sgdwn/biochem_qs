summary: "Vaccine hesitancy, fueled by misinformation, reduced disease awareness, and historical issues, leads to declining vaccination rates and the resurgence of preventable diseases, threatening public health."

Vaccine hesitancy is the concept of individuals choosing to not vaccinate their child, or deviating from the recommended schedules of vaccination. This has always been an issue, since Jenner developed the first vaccine in the 1800s (against smallpox). 

More recently, misleading information about vaccines has spread through both traditional and social media. This has caused a reduction in measles vaccination rates in many countries, initiated by the fraudulent research conducted by Wakefield in the early 2000s. These reductions in vaccination rates have led to outbreaks of preventable diseases, such as malaria and polio due to population immunity no longer being maintained. Many countries that had previously eradicated these diseases now have case levels that are too high for this description to be applied. 

Vaccination is also, in part, to blame for increasing vaccine hesitancy today. Vaccine-preventable diseases are incredibly uncommon, causing many people to not realise the severity of the infection. This creates a sense of security, making vaccination appear less important.
