SAGA complexes bind to UAS elements, allowing interaction by transcriptional activators (such as Gcn4 or Gal4) allowing transcription to be increased. This is caused by SAGA complexes loosening the interactions the DNA has with histone proteins, forming recognition sites for chromatin remodelling domains (and other bromodomains) to interact with the DNA. 
By driving the decondensation of DNA, and the activation of transcription, SAGA complexes play an important role in transcriptional activation, controlling histone hyperacetylation.
