The dead time of a reaction is the time between the reaction starting, and the first reading being taken. This time period can be reduced by using fast assay equipment, such as continuous flow or stopped flow. Both of these methods use pneumatic rams to force the reactants to mix as quickly as possible, reducing the dead time.
