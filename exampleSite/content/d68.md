Atomic force microscopy (AFM) is a microscopic technique used to visualise membrane proteins. This is done by attaching a section of membrane to a piezo-electric scanner. This allows for the sample to be moved small amounts, allowing a cantilever arm to tap across the surface and measure the heights. By measuring the heights of the membrane, a 3D rendering can be produced, allowing protein structure and membrane rafts to be observed. 
This technique results in the destruction of the membrane sample, and dragging the cantilever arm along would make it harder to get readings in a sequential manner. By tapping the arm, the membrane is not damaged as significantly, allowing for it to be studied properly.
