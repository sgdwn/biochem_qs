summary: "Population immunity occurs when a high percentage of a population is vaccinated, preventing pathogen spread, with the required vaccination rate dependent on the pathogen's transmissibility, the vaccine's effectiveness, and the pathogen only infecting humans."

Population immunity is the principle that if a sufficient proportion of the population is vaccinated against a pathogen, the pathogen will be unable to spread. This requires the pathogen to only infect humans, as if another organism is involved in the spread of the pathogen, it is not possible to prevent pathogen transmission easily. 

Normally, vaccination rates between 80 and 95% are required for population immunity to occur. However, the specific rate depends on the transmissibility of the pathogen (R0) and the vaccineâ€™s effectiveness.
