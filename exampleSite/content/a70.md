Enterohepatic cycling can result in the reabsorption of drug during excretion. The drug is removed from systemic circulation in the liver, and secreted into the ileum in the bile. The drug molecule may then be reabsorbed in the intestine, increasing the half-life of the drug.  

This recycling of the drug prolongs its activity on the body, and must be considered during the development process. A lower dose may be required if the drug is found to readily reabsorb when excreted back into the intestine.
