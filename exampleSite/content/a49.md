Pseudo-first order reaction kinetics can occur where the concentration of one reactant is vastly greater than the other (>10×). This allows the higher concentration [B] (in this case) to be treated as though it does not change, enabling the reaction to be viewed as a first order reaction. This reduces the number of concentrations that need to be considered, simplifying the analysis.
