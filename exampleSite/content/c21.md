VIOXX, also called rofecoxib, is a very strong Cox2 inhibitor. It binds so strongly that it resulted in cardiovascular complications and the subsequent death of a patient. The patient’s family undertook legal action against Merck, the pharmaceutical company marketing the drug, obtaining compensation. Merck withdrew the drug from the market. 

This was due to the drug’s thrombotic actions being incredibly strong, increasing the underlying risk of strokes.
