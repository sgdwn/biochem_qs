summary: "IgM and IgA are antibodies with distinct structures and functions: IgM initiates the immune response and IgA protects mucous membranes through secretion and agglutination."

IgM is a pentameric immunoglobulin, always appearing with five subunits. IgA can be either monomeric or dimeric, depending on its target location. If IgA is secreted, it will be dimeric and have the secretory component – an additional protein that improves the immunoglobulin’s resilience to enzymes found on mucous membranes. Systemic IgA (IgA in circulation) is monomeric, and does not have the secretory component. 

IgM is always the first antibody formed during a primary adaptive immune response. Helping with the expulsion of parasites, a quick response is required to prevent a parasite (eg- helminth) from invading beyond recovery. Class switching will occur if IgM is not the most effective antibody to respond to the infection. 

IgA is predominantly used to protect mucous membranes, being secreted onto the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and similar portals of entry. IgA is one of the most synthesised antibodies in the body, with upwards of 4g of protein being produced daily. It helps to coat pathogens in the GI tract, preventing them from binding to the wall of the ileum and invading. The dimeric structure of the secreted form allows pathogens to be clumped – agglutination – further preventing invasion.
