Plastoquinone is reduced at photosystem II to plastoquinol. The addition of two electrons induces the addition of two protons. Plastoquinol then transfers electrons to cytochrome b6f to allow the pumping of further protons across the membrane to the lumen. 

Plastoquinone allows the electrical linking of photosystem II and cytochrome b6f, enabling proton transport.
