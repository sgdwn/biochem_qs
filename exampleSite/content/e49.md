The number of repeats in minisatellite DNA sections can be used to identify familial lineages and forensics. 

Due to these differences in lengths, it is easy to cut out the desired minisatellite regions from the chromosomal DNA, and resolve their lengths on agarose gels. This is quick, easy, and cheap, making it ideal for crime scene forensics.
