summary: "CTLA-4 and PD receptors are checkpoint proteins that regulate T cell activity by sequestering B7 and inducing cell death, respectively, mechanisms that can be exploited by cancer cells but targeted by checkpoint inhibitors."

CTLA-4, cytotoxic T lymphocyte associated protein 4, is a membrane protein found on cytotoxic T cells that binds B7 with a high avidity. This effectively sequesters the B7 present on pathogenic cells, suppressing T cell activity by reducing the presence of signal 2. 

PD, programmed death, receptors are receptors found on the surface of T cells that recognise PD (programmed death) ligand. PD receptors are upregulated on activated T and B cells, allowing death to be induced rapidly after an infection is resolved. Mutant cells, such as cancer cells, can exploit PD receptors to suppress immune responses. Checkpoint inhibitors are used in these circumstances, preventing PD receptors from being used in this way.
