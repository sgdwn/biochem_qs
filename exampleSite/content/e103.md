Translation efficiency increases when more proteins are synthesised from a single mRNA. Therefore, a longer lifespan of an mRNA gives a greater translational efficiency. 
Where mRNA turnover increases, the translational efficiency decreases, due to this inverse correlation. 

A high mRNA turnover can give greater and more precise control of translation levels, allowing transcription to be more closely linked to the number of proteins synthesised.
