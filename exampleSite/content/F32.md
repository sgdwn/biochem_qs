summary: "Clonal selection is the process where B cells with antibodies matching a specific antigen are activated, proliferate, differentiate, and potentially undergo somatic hypermutation to improve antibody specificity."

Clonal selection is the process of selecting a suitable B cell with an antibody that corresponds to the detected antigen. A B cell is selected by its B cell receptor binding to the antigen, or a helper T cell presenting complementary material. This activates the B cell, inducing clonal expansion (essentially rapid cell division) and differentiation (into plasma cells and memory cells). Somatic hypermutation may then occur, allowing the antibody-antigen binding to be fine-tuned, making the antibody more specific for its target epitope.
