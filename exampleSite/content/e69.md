Transcriptional repressors do not have a binary off/on effect on gene expression, instead allowing transcription to occur over a range of values. This allows the combination of different repressor complexes to control gene expression levels more specifically. 

Repressor complexes are formed of a combination of activators and repressors, and are found at both actively transcribed genes and silent loci.
