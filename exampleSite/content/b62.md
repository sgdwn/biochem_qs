Nutrient acquisition is an important process in bacterial pathogenicity, especially in strict pathogens. Strict pathogens may not be able to synthesise certain essential metabolites, only being able to obtain them from the host. This acquisition is typically done by lysing surrounding host cells, releasing their contents.  

Siderophores are a chelating compound synthesised and released by bacteria. These molecules are unique to a specific species, although some species are able to take up siderophores produced by other species to increase their iron uptake.  

Using iron-binding proteins, the bacteria can remove the iron ion from the siderophore and make it available to metabolic and enzymatic processes in the bacterial cell.
