summary: "To combat the increasing threat of emerging infectious diseases exacerbated by climate change, advancements in rapid vaccine development and improved antigen immunogenicity are crucial."

Emerging infectious diseases can employ new methods of pathogenesis, have antigens with poor immunogenicity in vaccines, and transmit quickly. 

Developing effective platform technologies to allow vaccines for different classes of pathogen to be developed quickly, as well as working on techniques to improve the immunogenicity of antigens, could improve the speed of response and efficacy of the vaccine. 

As climate change progresses, the likelihood of infectious diseases emerging increases. This is due to changing migration patterns of animals, and humans interacting with different organisms. Breakdown of public health functions during natural disasters will also expose humans to novel pathogens.
