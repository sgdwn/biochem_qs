summary: "Animal serum and hybridoma cells are used to produce polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies respectively, which can be administered to provide passive immunity, although polyclonal antibodies carry a risk of unwanted side effects due to their lower specificity."

Animal serum is able to be used to convey passive immunity to a specific antigen by infecting/exposing the animal with the antigen of interest. This causes antibody matching that epitope to be secreted into the blood, which can then be transferred to a human via a transfusion. 

Although this was successful at treating patients (against toxins and pathogenic infections), polyclonal antibodies can be less specific and may cause unwanted side effects (eg- serum sickness). 

Monoclonal antibodies take the same principle of administering exogenous antibodies to a patient to convey passive immunity, but contain identical antibodies that all bind the same epitope. To obtain monoclonal antibodies, the plasma (B) cell that produces the antibody of interest is fused with a cancer cell, forming an immortal hybridoma cell. This hybridoma cell is capable of synthesising high levels of the antibody of interest.
