summary: "Artificial passive immunization provides temporary immunity through administered antibodies to combat specific infections lacking alternative treatments, but its use is limited due to high costs, short-lived effects, and potential side effects."

Artificial passive immunisation allows a patient to have temporary immunity against a specific antigen by having an antibody administered. This prevents the patient from being infected by that pathogen, or supports the resolution of the infection. 

In clinical settings, artificial passive immunisation can be used in complex infections that are not being dealt with by the immune system, and where there is not a small-molecule drug available (eg- antibiotics). 

However, artificial passive immunisation only conveys short-lived immunity. The drugs to do this can be expensive, especially monoclonal antibodies. Therefore, it is only used in limited circumstances where there is no other option for treatment. Some patients can experience side effects from a monoclonal antibody being administered, including cytokine storms and serum sickness.
