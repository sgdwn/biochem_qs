Vaccine development involves a series of steps to ensure safety and efficacy. 

Once a pathogen has been identified, the type of vaccine must be determined. Traditional types of vaccines include live attenuated and killed/inactivated. More modern types that have been developed with genetic engineering approaches are classified as subunit vaccines, due to their inclusion of only a particular part of the pathogen instead of the complete pathogen, and include conjugate, RNA/DNA, and viral vector. 

The candidate vaccine must then be developed.

After the candidate vaccine has been developed, it must undergo safety testing to ensure it meets the requirements for human administration. The first stage will involve in vitro studies to ensure the vaccine does not interfere with critical body functions, and that the vaccine can activate immune cells. In vivo studies will then be conducted in model organisms, allowing the immune response to be observed, and the immunity the vaccine creates to be tested. In vivo studies also allow the safety profile to be determined, and the preliminary dosing regimes to be created. 

After testing in the lab is complete, and all requirements satisfied, clinical trials will begin. The first phase involves testing the safety of the vaccine in human volunteers. By administering the vaccine to a small number of healthy participants, any common side effects / adverse reactions can be identified. This ensures the vaccine will not cause organ failure / death in subsequent, larger studies. 

Phase II aims to determine the efficacy of the vaccine. Administered to a larger number of participants, the number of infections post-vaccination can be determined. If they are lower than a control group, after statistical analysis, the vaccineâ€™s efficacy can be determined. 

To confirm the efficacy of the vaccine, phase III recruits a larger cohort of participants to confirm the findings. During a disease outbreak, where quick results are required from the clinical trial phase, phase II and III can be combined. Adaptive study design allows changes to be made to the study design while the trial is ongoing without impacting the integrity of the results, allowing more options (such as dosing regimes and concentrations) to be tested in a shorter period of time. 

These processes, in vitro and in vivo vaccine testing, help ensure the safety and efficacy of the vaccine before clinical use begins.
