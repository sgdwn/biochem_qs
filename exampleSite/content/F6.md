summary: "Pre-formed mediators are essential innate immune components that are either rapidly activated from inactive precursors (like complement C3) or are constitutively active (like defensins) to provide an immediate defense against infection without requiring prior recognition."

Pre-formed mediators (PFM) are an essential component of innate immunity, allowing rapid responses to infections. 
A PFM is a biologically inactive precursor of an immune component. On activation, the precursor form of the mediator is rapidly converted to the biologically active form. For example, complement protein C3 is an example of a PFM. In the classical activation pathway of the complement system, the interaction of C1q with C2 and C4 catalyses the conversion of C3 into C3a and C3b. C3b then activates the rest of the complement cascade, recruiting immune cells to the site of infection via chemotaxis and formation of the membrane attack complex (MAC) by activating C5, C6, C7, C8, and C9 polymerisation. 
Some PFMs are biologically active after synthesis, such as defensins. Defensins are cationic peptides that disrupt bacterial cell membranes. Due to differences between prokaryotic/viral and eukaryotic membranes, it is possible for defensins to specifically target bacteria, fungi, and enveloped viruses.  
Constitutively expression PFMs ensures the innate immune system is always ready to respond to an infection, absolving the need to recognise an infection.
