Heterocysts play an important role in fixing nitrogen in filamentous cyanobacteria when low levels of fixed nitrogen are present in the environment.  

Cells along a filamentous cyanobacteria are capable of differentiating into heterocysts at regular intervals, with fixed nitrogen diffusing along the length of the filament to neighbouring vegetative cells.  

During the formation of a heterocyst, the cell wall thickens to allow oxygen to be excluded. The formation of a microoxic environment is important during nitrogen fixation â€“ nitrogenase is inhibited by the presence of oxygen. Neighbouring vegetative cells provide sucrose to the heterocyst.
