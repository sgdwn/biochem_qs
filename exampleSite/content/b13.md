Attenuation is the premature termination of an RNA transcript, preventing the complete protein from being synthesised.  

The antitermination conformation will only be adopted with the relevant metabolite is present to change the secondary structure of the RNA. This change to the RNA allows the ribosome to bind successfully and transcribe the entire protein. This is similar to a spring-loaded lock, defaulting to closed until it is twisted. The RNA is not able to be transcribed until the metabolite / small molecule binds to the transcript.
