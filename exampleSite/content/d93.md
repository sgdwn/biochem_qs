Membrane channels are simple transmembrane protein structures, allowing the formation of a channel in the membrane. Due to the absence of any further structures, these are mainly used to transport small molecules than can be selected for passively. This could include porins, found in the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria. 
Hydrophilic residues are found within the channel, while hydrophobic residues are found in the exterior portion, interacting with the plasma membrane.
