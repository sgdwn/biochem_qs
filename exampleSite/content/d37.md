Most group carriers are nucleotide-derivative molecules, which has led to the conclusion that these molecules likely arose through the RNA world hypothesis. It is likely group carriers were involved in both catalysis and genetic information storage - RNA molecules still possess catalytic activity today in the form of ribozymes, and contain genetic information in RNA viruses as well as mRNA.
