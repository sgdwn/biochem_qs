Fimbriae and pili are essentially the same thing. Adhesins are small proteins produced by bacteria to allow them to stick to a target tissue / cell. 

Pili are hair-like protein projections, with minor pilins found on the end of the pilus binding to almost any surface. When the pilus is pulled, the pilins at the end of the pilus (bound to the surface) unfold slightly, increasing the strength of the binding.
