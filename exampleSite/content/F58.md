summary: "MHC polymorphisms are crucial in transplantation, autoimmune disease, and mate selection due to their impact on immune response and diversity."
---
MHC polymorphisms are important to consider during organ transplantation and autoimmune disease. Different forms of MHC are present in the human population, improving diversity of peptide recognition and therefore improving the chance of a successful immune response. 

If a different MHC type is present on a transplanted organ, the MHC will be recognised as foreign, and trigger an immune response. Therefore, checking the patient and donor MHC types before donation is an important step to prevent graft rejection. 

MHC is thought to influence an individual's choice of mate. Increasing MHC diversity is in evolutionâ€™s interest, so having a way of recognising this during mate selection is beneficial (as it reduces the risk of not recognising an infection). This is thought to be done through pheromones.
