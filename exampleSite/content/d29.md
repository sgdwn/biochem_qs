An Mg2+ ion binds to rubisco during the Calvin, making the enzyme catalytically active. The activation of rubisco by Mg2+ binding allows it to react ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate with CO2. This carboxylation step is important in allowing the Calvin cycle to complete, producing metabolic products that can be used in the mitochondria and other cellular processes.
