Cyanobacteria have broad potential in biotechnology. Due to their ability to photosynthesis, less energy needs to be provided in the bioreactor, reducing cost and complexity. The natural environment cyanobacteria grow in – large bodies of water (among others) – also reduces cost due to the variability in conditions giving cyanobacteria high levels of metabolic flexibility (reducing the need to maintain specific growth conditions).  

Cyanobacteria could be used in the synthesis of biofuels, bioplastics, sugars, ... 

The limitations in commercialising cyanobacteria for biosynthesis include the inability to grow cyanobacteria in large cultures. This requires more research to allow high-volume synthesis to take place. Cyanobacteria have polyploid genomes, which decreases their genetic stability. The ability to lose plasmids is also prominent in cyanobacteria. E. coli and yeast genomes are more stable, and transformation techniques are able to maintain plasmids for many generations.
