summary: "Innate immunity provides a rapid, non-specific defense against pathogens and activates the adaptive immune system to mount a more targeted response."
---
Innate immunity is fast-acting, which is important in higher organisms that also have an adaptive immune system. This allows the organism to immediately begin targeting a pathogen before the adaptive response has an opportunity to develop specificity and become active. 
Innate immunity is non-specific, and helps activate the adaptive immune system through chemokines and cytokines, providing the trigger for a bigger immune response.
