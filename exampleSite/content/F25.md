summary: "Dendritic cells are phagocytic immune cells with high MHC II expression that capture and present foreign antigens to T cells, initiating adaptive immunity while avoiding self-attack."

Dendritic cells are a type of phagocytic cell, although they are less effective than macrophages and neutrophils at taking up cells. Dendritic cells use their long, finger-like projections to take up foreign material to present to other immune cells. This allows the activation of the immune system, through T cells. Activation of the adaptive immune system is important in developing immunity against the antigen that has been identified. 

Constitutive expression of self-proteins ensures the immune system does not react against the dendritic cell, and high levels of MHC II expression ensure foreign material can easily be presented on the cell surface.
