summary: "Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are pattern recognition receptors that detect pathogens by recognizing their molecular patterns, triggering intracellular signaling pathways that lead to cytokine production and activation of the immune system."

TLRs are a type of pattern recognition receptor (PRR) used by cells to detect pathogen presence. 

Humans have 10 different TLRs, each recognising a different pattern. This allows an immune response to be mounted when common features/structures of pathogens are detected. The PRR domain is a leucine-rich repeat that forms a hook shape. 

On binding a ligand, the TLR activates an intracellular signalling pathway that upregulates the transcription of cytokines. Cytokines are signalling molecules that are released by the cell to activate other components of the immune system, such as chemotaxis of phagocytic cells (eg- macrophages).
