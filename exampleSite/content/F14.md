summary: "CD59, along with other inhibitory mediators, prevents the complement system from attacking self-cells by interfering with the formation of the membrane attack complex, and deficiencies in these mediators can lead to autoimmune diseases."

Inhibitory mediators are present in host cells, such as Factors H and I, and CD59. These prevent complement proteins from polymerising on self-cells. For example, CD59 sequesters C9 before it is able to form the membrane attack complex. This prevents the MAC inserting into self-cells. 
Some disease pathologies are caused by deficiencies in these mediatory signals, and can lead to autoimmune conditions (eg- macular degeneration). 
It’s important the immune system doesn’t react to self cells, and the complement system has developed through evolution to prevent it from targeting self-cells. 
Factor h and I are not directly relevant to host cells specifically. Only cd59 here.
