summary: "Mutations in RAG1-RAG2 or TdT impair antibody diversity, causing severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID)."
---
Mutations in the RAG1-RAG2 proteins or terminal deoxynucleotide transferase (TdT) lead to SCID. These mutations impair the protein function, preventing the generation of antibody diversity required for the adaptive immune system to mount a proper antibody response. SCID leads to immunodeficiency in the patient.
