Specific chemicals, which bind to certain amino acid sequences and motifs, can be used to interfere with protein function. This can allow study of protein activity by preventing the binding of a substrate or other ligand, potentially reducing the enzyme’s function. This may not always occur though, if the chemical being used binds to a different area of the protein (perhaps an allosteric site but does not induce a conformational change).
