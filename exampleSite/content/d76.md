MS is caused by a degenerating of the myelin sheath surrounding axons in the central nervous system. This prevents saltatory conduction from being used, slowing nervous transmission. Slowing transmission makes it harder to send action potentials, suppressing intercellular communication and making responses to stimuli slower.
