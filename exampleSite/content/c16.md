Body fat can act as a reservoir of a drug, allowing it to accumulate without having a therapeutic effect. This is more commonly seen in individuals with a greater proportion of body fat. 

Increased levels of body fat reduces the concentration of the drug within the rest of the body, causing it to have a lower therapeutic effect. This requires higher doses to increase the drugâ€™s distribution throughout the body and to subsequently obtain the intended result.
