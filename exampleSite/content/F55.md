summary: "Junctional diversity, created by TdT adding random nucleotides to gene segments, increases the range of peptides T cell receptors can recognize, improving the likelihood of T cell activation by foreign peptides."

Junctional diversity is found in T cell receptors, and is the same process as seen in the generation of antibody diversity.

This is caused by the activation of terminal deoxynucleotide transferase (TdT). TdT adds an indeterminate number of random nucleotides to the beginning / end of the gene segments, introducing diversity. 

Increasing the diversity of T cell receptors is important, increasing the range of peptides that can be recognised. This makes it more likely that a foreign peptide bound to MHC will be able to activate the T cell.
