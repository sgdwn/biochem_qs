Unipolar depression is a shifting of mood in a single, negative direction. Bipolar depression consists of a shifting of mood between mania and depression. Both are likely to have a genetic basis, although this is not fully understood. Different treatments are required for unipolar and bipolar depression, due to the different regions of the brain that are affected.
