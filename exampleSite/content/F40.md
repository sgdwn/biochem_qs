summary: "RAG1-RAG2 is a specialized endonuclease essential for antibody diversity in developing B and T cells; mutations in these genes can cause severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), requiring stem cell transplants and strict isolation from pathogens."

RAG1-RAG2 is a specialised endonuclease used for somatic recombination during antibody diversity generation. This endonuclease is able to cut and rejoin the chromosomal DNA, solely recognising the V(, D), and J gene segments. 

RAG1-RAG2 is only active in developing B and T cells, preventing it from disrupting normal cellular function. 

It is only possible to fix mutations in RAG1 or RAG2 with stem cell transplants. Where these mutations are present, the patient has severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), and must prevent any exposure to any pathogen.
