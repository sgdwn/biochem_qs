summary: "Sequencing myeloma cell-secreted proteins revealed antibody structure, including variable loops, constant domains, and the globular domain organization."
---
Sequencing the proteins secreted from myeloma cells allowed antibody structure to be determined. Highly variable loops were identified, and constant domains were found as well. The globular domain structure of antibodies was developed from sequencing these monoclonal proteins.
