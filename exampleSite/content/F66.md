summary: "Thymic selection, particularly through medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTEC) expressing self-proteins, eliminates self-reactive T cells in the thymus to prevent autoimmunity."
---
Thymic selection is the process of eliminating any T cells that react to self proteins. This is carried out in the thymus, during T cell maturation, and is important to prevent autoimmune diseases. 

Medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTEC) are one mechanism to identify T cells that recognise self proteins. By expressing all self proteins, any T cells that identify these can be identified, and apoptosis induced.
