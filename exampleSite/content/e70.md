HOX genes play an important role in anterior-posterior development, controlling the position, number, and location of physiological structures (spatial and temporal expression). 
Due to these genes being organised in a ‘box’ they are located together, allowing deletion, inversion, and other mutation types to have a significant impact on the final organism.
