summary: "T cell tolerance, established through mechanisms like mTEC-mediated antigen presentation and AIRE-regulated expression in the thymus along with positive and negative selection, eliminates autoreactive T cells to prevent autoimmunity."

T cell tolerance is an important process during T cell maturation, ensuring any autoreactive T cells are eliminated. This reduces the risk of autoimmune reactions. 

Medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTEC) are present in the thymus, and express every protein in the human proteome. This allows any T cells that bind these proteins to be identified and eliminated through apoptosis. AIRE, autoimmune regulator, is a regulatory gene that allows every antigen in the genome to be expressed. 

Positive and negative selection are employed to ensure T cells bind MHC with the correct affinity. Those that bind too strongly / weakly are eliminated via apoptosis.
