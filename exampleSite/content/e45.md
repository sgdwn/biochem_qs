Telomere binding proteins bind to telomeres on chromosomes, preventing their degradation by nucleases, as well as differentiating telomeres from strand breaks. 
By forming t-loops, the ends of the telomeres are protected, helping to prevent their degradation from enzymes. 

Telomere-binding proteins are also able to induce DNA repair, where there are absent or non-functional factors in the Shelterin complex. p53 (to initiate apoptosis), non-homologous end joining, and nucleotide excision repair can all be activated by discrepancies in the shelterin complex. 

Some forms of cancers can be attributed to abnormalities in telomere-binding proteins, including skin cancers and tumours.
