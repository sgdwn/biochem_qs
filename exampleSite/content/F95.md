summary: "Checkpoint inhibitors, a form of immunotherapy, work by blocking immune checkpoints that cancer cells manipulate to suppress the immune system, thereby enabling the immune system to target and destroy the cancer."

Immune checkpoints are important regulatory processes in immune responses, allowing the immune response to be controlled, ensuring it is proportionate to the nature of the infection. These regulatory mechanisms are vital in suppressing immune activity after an infection has been resolved. 

Some cancer cells can manipulate these immune checkpoints, suppressing immune activity. This allows the cancer to proliferate more, as it is unable to be targeted by the immune system. This allows the cancer cells to suppress the activity of the immune system, even where the cell is presenting non-self peptides / has different antigens on its external membrane. 


Checkpoint inhibitors are a class of drug that suppress (or inhibit) the activity of these immune checkpoints, enabling the cancer cells to be targeted by the immune system again. 

This is a form of immunotherapy, as is becoming more prominent (although still relatively uncommon due to low numbers of approved drugs, well understood existing drugs, and the drugs being more expensive than small-molecule chemotherapy agents).
