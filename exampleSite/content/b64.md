Having two copies of the chromosome in a myxospore means that the cell is ready to divide and the chromosome does not need to be duplicated. The copies required for each daughter cell are already present in the cell, they just need to be segregated.  

Removing the need to duplicate the chromosome means division can start immediately on germination, increasing the speed of the first division.
