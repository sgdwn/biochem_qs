summary: "Adaptive immunity provides a specific and targeted immune response, including antibody production and immunological memory, to effectively combat pathogens."

Adaptive immunity is important in allowing an organism to mount a strong, specific, and targeted response to a pathogen. This allows a specific pathogen to be targeted, as opposed to the more general and less specific response of the innate immune system. Can give a memory response. 
Adaptive immunity enables antibody synthesis, which is important in targeting other parts of the immune system to the pathogen.
