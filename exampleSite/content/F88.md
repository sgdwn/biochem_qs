Antibody structure contributes towards their biological function in both research and medicine. 

Antibodies can take one of five structures: IgG, IgM, IgA, IgD, and IgE. These all have specialised biological functions, making accessing some regions of the body easier to resolve an infection more quickly. For example, IgG is the smallest type of antibody, allowing it to access tissues via circulation. IgA is secreted onto mucous membranes, and has a ‘secretory component’ to protect it from the hydrolytic enzymes found in these areas. IgM is always the first antibody to be synthesised on primary infection, supporting parasite expulsion (regardless whether the infection is caused by a parasite or not). 

In research, antibodies can be used to identify molecules (eg- proteins, …) in a sample. For example, IgG can be immobilised in a well of a plate for ELISA assays (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay). IgG is also used in pregnancy and SARS-CoV-19 lateral flow tests, giving quick results on the presence of an antigen.
