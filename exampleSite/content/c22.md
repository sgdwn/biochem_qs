Inflammatory mediators result in inflammation. In a sufferer of rheumatoid arthritis, this results in the synovium within the joints becoming inflamed due to an autoimmune reaction, leading to the degradation of the synovium and subsequent exposure of bones leading to painful sensations when moving joints. 

Due to the degradation of protective tissue at joints, the sufferer experiences high levels of pain. 

Using drugs that inhibit the production of inflammatory mediators, immunosuppressants, it is possible to prevent the degradation of the synovium and subsequently preserve the joint tissue. This causes a reduction in the swelling and subsequently leads to less pain.
