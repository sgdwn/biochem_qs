Cyanotoxins and cyanobactins are both toxic peptides produced by some cyanobacteria. These short proteins of 7-10 amino acids in a circular molecule form many interactions with the target. Due to the interaction with the target as well as the potency, these molecules have potential pharmaceutical applications.  

Cyanotoxins and cyanobactins could be used as potent inhibitors of receptors and proteins, forming strong (permanent) interactions that cannot be overcome.
