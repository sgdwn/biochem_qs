Chromatin remodelling complexes (CRMs) are proteins able to push nucleosomes ‘out of the way’ as they move along the DNA. This allows the stimulation of transcription. 

CRMs are recruited to the DNA by SAGA complexes, which bind at UAS elements. This enables CRMs to bind to the DNA, opening up condensed structures and subsequently making it more accessible to transcription machinery.
