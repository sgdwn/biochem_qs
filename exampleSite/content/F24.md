summary: "Monocytes are short-lived blood cells that differentiate into macrophages or dendritic cells, while macrophages are long-lived tissue-resident cells that perform phagocytosis, antigen presentation, and cytokine release, acting as sentinels for infection."

Monocytes are a type of leukocyte that is able to differentiate into macrophages and dendritic cells on migration from circulation into tissue. 

Both monocytes and macrophages are capable of phagocytosis, although macrophages are more efficient after the differentiation from a monocyte. Antigen presentation and cytokine release are possible by both macrophages and monocytes.

Monocytes are found in the blood, where they are secreted from bone marrow. Macrophages are tissue-resident, seeded into tissue during foetal development. Macrophages in different tissues have different names: microglial cells (brain), alveolar macrophages (lungs). 

Monocytes are short-lived, differentiating into macrophages or dendritic cells 1-3 days after bone marrow release. Macrophages have long lifespans, in months-years, allowing them to act as sentinel cells, usually being the first cells to detect infection in the body.
