The group carrier SAM binds to methyl groups, and is involved in most reactions involving these groups. 

SAM catalyses the methylation of DNA, histones, and the synthesis of ethylene. This allows control of gene expression (through methylation of DNA and histones), and fruit ripening (with ethylene). SAM is therefore a very important group carrier found in cells.
