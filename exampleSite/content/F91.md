summary: "Engineered antibodies can be designed to target unique cancer cell epitopes, improving therapeutic outcomes by directing the immune system, delivering drugs, or triggering cell death."

Antibody engineering can be used to modify the epitope that is recognised by the antibody, allowing any epitope to be recognised. 

Cancer cells usually have epitopes that are different to non-cancerous self-cells, allowing antibodies that target these to be developed. 

These engineered antibodies can be used to improve therapeutic outcomes by: targeting the patientâ€™s immune system to the cancer cells (opsonisation / agglutination); delivering a conjugated drug molecule directly to the cancer cells; binding to cancer cell death receptors (programmed death receptor), activating the caspase cascade leading to apoptosis.
