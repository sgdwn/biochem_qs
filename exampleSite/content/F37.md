summary: "V(D)J recombination is a process involving recombination signal sequences that increases antibody diversity by rearranging gene segments in a specific order to recognize a wide range of epitopes."

V(D)J recombination is the process of recombining the different gene segments that make up an antibody gene, during somatic recombination, to increase diversity of antibodies. 

There are different gene segments present, which can be combined in different orders to allow different epitopes to be recognised by the encoded antibody. 

Recombination signal sequences are found at the start and end of each gene segment. They are either 12bp or 23bp long, and ensure that only one V(, D,) and J segment is included in the final sequence. These sequences work in a similar way to Velcro, allowing only one of each to be retained, and forcing binding in the correct order.
