summary: "The Dryer and Bennet hypothesis explains how immunoglobulins achieve diversity through the recombination of multiple variable, joining, and constant gene segments during somatic recombination, allowing for the creation of a wide range of antibody structures."

The Dryer and Bennet hypothesis describes how immunoglobulins are composed of different gene segments, and this structure allows the diversity of immunoglobulins to be increased significantly. There are multiple variable, joining, and constant gene segments present in the genome, and these are recombined during somatic recombination to give different antibody structures. The IgM constant gene segment is always used in naive B cells, but class switching may occur on subsequent activation.
