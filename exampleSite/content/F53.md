summary: "T cell receptors and antibodies, both immunoglobulin superfamily members with variable and constant domains, differ in their structure, membrane association, signaling mechanisms, and the requirement for accessory proteins."
---
T cell receptors (TCR) and antibodies share some similarities in their structure. Both proteins are found within the immunoglobulin gene superfamily, and both have variable and constant domains. 

TCRs have 2 constant and 2 variable domains, with a stalk inserting into the membrane to anchor it to the cell. 
Antibodies have 6 constant and 4 variable domains, and are usually soluble proteins. In B cells, antibodies can be membrane-bound, allowing recognition of foreign antigen. The ratio between membrane-bound and soluble antibodies expressed by B cells is controlled by CstF64. 

TCRs have accessory proteins to support signalling in the cell. Epsilon-delta-gamma-epsilon proteins have iTAM motifs that extend into the cytoplasm to enable signalling. This is important, as the stalks of the alpha and beta proteins of the TCR do not extend into the cytoplasm or have any intracellular signalling domains. Zeta is also used, projecting into the cytoplasm with iTAM motifs to further enhance the signalling activation.

Antibodies do not require the ability to activate signalling pathways, eliminating the need for accessory proteins.
