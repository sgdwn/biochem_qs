summary: "IgD, a monomeric immunoglobulin found mainly in the respiratory tract and as a B cell receptor, plays a role in controlling inflammation despite its low serum concentration."
---
IgD is a monomeric immunoglobulin, with 2 antigen-binding Fab arms. The hinge region is very long, providing high levels of articulation and flexibility in binding antigen. The long hinges allow IgD to be a receptor on B cells. 

Predominantly found in the respiratory tract, IgD is important in controlling the release of inflammatory mediators. Low levels are expressed, with IgD making up less than 1% of serum immunoglobulins.
