summary: "AID-deficient patients cannot effectively fight infections due to their inability to produce diverse antibody classes beyond IgM."

Patients that do not express AID are unable to undergo class switching during the adaptive immune response. They therefore can only produce IgM, which is not the most efficient antibody to combat infection.
