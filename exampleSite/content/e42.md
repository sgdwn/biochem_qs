Centromeres are important in allowing equal segregation of chromosomes during mitosis and meiosis, enabling the binding of spindle fibres. This allows individual chromatin to be separated to opposite poles of the cell, ensuring the correct distribution of chromatin. 

Centromeres contain different histone proteins - CENP-A. This allows the spindle fibres to bind, as well as identify the centromeric region(s). 

Some chromosomes can have several centromeres - these are called holocentric chromosomes. This allows multiple spindle fibres to bind to the same chromatin. Instead of dragging the chromatin in a ‘V’ shape as seen in monocentric chromosomes, they are observed moving in a more linear ‘I’ shape. Using holocentric chromosomes can provide benefits where a chromosome has been destabilised by double strand breaks.
