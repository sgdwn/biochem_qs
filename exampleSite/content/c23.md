Methotrexate is an immunosuppressant that is generally the first drug prescribed to patientâ€™s diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis. By suppressing the immune system, inflammatory mediators causing inflammation of the synovium are produced in lower quantities. This leads to a reduction in the inflammation and subsequent reducing in pain. 

Sulfasalazine is a free-radical scavenger. As neutrophils rely on free-radicals being present for activation, the removal of these reduces neutrophil activity and subsequently suppresses the immune response. This reduces the inflammation of the synovium and thus reduces the pain a patient experiences. The complete mechanism of action for sulfasalazine is not fully understood. 

Both of these drugs are DMARDs, identified by chance, not design.
