Stable ADP and Pi concentrations are necessary for ATP synthesis, allowing the binding of ADP and Pi to the F1 subunit. To allow this binding to occur at the intended rate, a constant and specific concentration is required. Changes in this concentration can result in binding sites on the F1 subunit being vacant and subsequently reduced ATP synthesis for the same number of protons. This decreases the efficiency of ATP synthesis.
