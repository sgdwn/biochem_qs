summary: "MHC molecules are crucial for T cell activation by presenting peptides, and T cells are restricted to recognizing only self-MHC molecules, meaning they cannot be activated by foreign MHC."
---
MHC is essential for T cell activation, presenting peptides to T cell receptors to induce the activation of T cells in the presence of foreign peptides. 

MHC restriction describes the observation that T cells can only recognise self-MHC. If a T cell is taken from another individual, and the MHC does not match sufficiently, T cell activation will be impossible.
