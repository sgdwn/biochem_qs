summary: "Clonal selection is the process by which B cells with receptors matching a specific antigen proliferate, differentiate into antibody-secreting plasma cells and memory cells, and undergo processes like somatic hypermutation and recombination to improve antibody specificity for a strong immune response."

Clonal selection describes the process of selecting a B cell to proliferate for antibody synthesis during an infection activating the adaptive immune system. All B cells in the body have different B cell receptors, allowing almost any antigen to be recognised. When an antigen binds to a specific B cell receptor, the B cell becomes activated, allowing proliferation and differentiation to ensue. 

High levels of antibody synthesis are required for a strong and effective immune response, so many B cells must be produced. Some of the B cells differentiate to memory cells. These remain in circulation for a prolonged period after the initial infection, allowing secondary responses to be mounted on subsequent exposure to the same pathogen. Most of the proliferated B cells become plasma cells, secreting large quantities of antibody - this is important for the immediate defence against the pathogen. 

During the differentiation process, various mechanisms allow the binding specificity of the antibody to be increased. Somatic hypermutation, junctional diversity, and somatic recombination all contribute towards improving the specificity of the antibody. 
Somatic hypermutation increases the mutation rate during replication. This is targeted to specific regions of the genome, complementarity determining regions (CDRs), which are hypervariable and convey the specificity of the antibody for its epitope. 
Junctional diversity is caused by terminal deoxynucleotide transferase (TdT), an error-prone polymerase that inserts random nucleotides at the boundaries between the V(, D,) and J gene segments, increasing diversity further. 
Somatic recombination is the process of recombining different gene segments, variable, diversity, and junctional, in different ways to provide diversity of these sections.
