summary: "Adjuvants are essential components in some vaccines, particularly those using subunit, inactivated pathogen, conjugate, or virus vector technologies, because they boost the immune response and ensure the development of long-lasting immunity by inducing inflammation and promoting memory cell formation."

Adjuvants are necessary to elicit a strong immune response with some types of vaccine, helping to convey long-lasting immunity. By inducing an inflammatory response, the immune system becomes more active, supporting the formation of memory cells. 

Independently, some types of vaccine (such as subunit and inactivated pathogen vaccines) are unable to elicit an immune response of adequate strength to make the vaccine effective. If long-lasting immunity, through the formation of memory B cells, is not formed, the vaccine will not be useful. 

Adjuvants are one component of a vaccine, and are typically combined with surfactants (to keep the vaccine mixed in storage), preservatives (such as aluminium salts), diluent (normally sterile water), stabilisers, and residuals (components left over from the manufacturing processes). 

Using an adjuvant is necessary with some vaccine technologies, including conjugate, inactivated, and virus vectors. Without an adjuvant, the immune response would not be strong enough to form immunity to the pathogen.
