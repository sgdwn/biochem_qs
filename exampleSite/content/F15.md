summary: "Sentinel immune cells, residing in tissues, initiate immune responses by detecting infections, recruiting other immune cells, and releasing inflammatory mediators to activate the immune system."

Tissue-resident cells, such as some macrophages and mast cells, are ‘sentinel’ as they help detect infections in exposed regions of the body (such as mucosal surfaces, the skin, …). These cells can elicit an immune response by recruiting mobile cells, through the release of chemoattractants. 
Sentinel immune cells typically release inflammatory mediators (such as histamine) to induce inflammation and activate more of the immune system. 
Often first to respond / detect infection.
